 *  @abstract Every instance of this class represents a <i>publisher</i> entity.

 *	Each user can choose to have the option to publish apps on the relayr platform and they are then assigned a publisherId.
 *
 *  All RelayrSDK objects (except when explicitly said otherwise) will return the same instance when copied (e.g.: when added to a dictionary). Thus the <code>NSCopying</code> method <code>-copyWithZone:</code> will return the same instance. Same happening with <code>NSMutableCopying</code> method <code>-mutableCopyWithZone:</code>.
