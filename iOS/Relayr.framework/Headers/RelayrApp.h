/*!
 *  @abstract Represents a relayr Application which allows interaction with the relayr Cloud.
 *  @discussion An app is a basic entity in the relayr platform. 
 *	The relayr platform relates to apps in two manners: Publisher Apps and User Apps.
 *	Publisher apps are apps which are purchasable on an app store and are owned by a publisher.
 *	User apps are apps which have been approved to receive the data of an end user. This approval has been granted by the user.
 *
 *  All RelayrSDK objects (except when explicitly said otherwise) will return the same instance when copied (e.g.: when added to a dictionary). Thus the <code>NSCopying</code> method <code>-copyWithZone:</code> will return the same instance. Same happening with <code>NSMutableCopying</code> method <code>-mutableCopyWithZone:</code>.
